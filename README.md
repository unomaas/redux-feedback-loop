# React Feedback Review App

Thanks for looking into my weekend project, the React feedback review web app! 



## Description:

Duration: Weekend Sprint

This is a web based application that uses React to interact with a virtual server and database.  The objective was to get hands-on experience working with React to build a full-stack app using CRUD methodology and Router capability.  

The app functionality will take the user through a simple "feedback" process, asking them to leave feedback on how they're feeling, how they're understanding content, how well supported they feel, and if there's any comments.  

At the end of the feedback process, the app will review their choices displayed on the DOM, and be able to submit their feedback to the database.  After submission, they may leave new feedback again, if desired.  



## Prerequisites:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

- PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/



## Installation:

To run this program, you will need to:

- [] Build the database in your SQL server with the code in "database.sql" file. 

- [] Run 'npm install' in your terminal to install the dependencies.

- [] Run 'npm run server' in one terminal, and 'npm run client' in another terminal.



## Usage:

- #1. To use this app, start the server and client in your terminal.  React will navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.  

- #2. The app will ask the user a series of question of how they're feeling in relation to the content.  The user will navigate to the next page with the buttons displayed. 

- #3. After all questions are answered, the user can review their answers before submitting them to the database.

- #4. After submission, the user may choose to leave new feedback, if desired.  



### Accessibility: 

I strive to make my apps accessible to all!  

This specific app is dyslexia-friendly, with a custom font, "OpenDyslexia", added to the server. 


### Built With:
